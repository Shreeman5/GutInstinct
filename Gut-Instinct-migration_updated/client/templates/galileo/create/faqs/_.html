                        <p>Example: Suppose you’re curious to know the effect of yogurt on your gut, but travel to
                            another country during the process. This change acts as a confounder - so we don’t know if
                            any changes are due to yogurt, or due to change in the brand of the yogurt</p>

                <p>Why run experiments with a large number of people?</p>
                <p>Experiments run with you might be biased and might not create generalizable knowledge. Running
                    experiments with more people allows us to create gold standard scientific knowledge</p>
