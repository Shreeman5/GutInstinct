      <b>Why survey</b>
      <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
          You'll need to administer surveys to collect information about people - before you randomly put them in conditions etc.. - teach about pre- and post-survey
          <br>Example: frgqrggfr3
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
          You want to understand how your participants felt - what worked for them - what did not - how do you improve your thing - to receive open-ended feedback
          <br>Example: frgqrggfr3
        </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
          You want to get metrics for other factors like did people like your system, did they find it easy to use, would they recommend it? This information at scale can be really useful
          <br>Example: ...
        </li>
      </ul>
  
      <br>
  
      <b>Here's a template you can use</b>

          How would you create surveys
          <br>3 pt scale vs 5 pt scale - Likert (statistical analysis confidence)
