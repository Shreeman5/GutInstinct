      <p>An experiment demonstrates which effect shows up when the cause is changed. In its simplest form, one can change the cause once, observe its effect and claim to have run an experiment. But there is a chance that this experiment was biased by many factors and running the experiment again would provide different outcomes. To account for this challenge, experiments include multiple runs. To further generalize the findings, an experiment is run with many participants so the specific biases of one user do not overwhelm the results of the experiment.</p>
      <p>A between-subjects randomized controlled experiment tackles these challenges</p>

                    probiotic yogurt on sleep quality, some people will ALWAYS consume "brand A" probiotic yogurt while
                    others will ALWAYS consume normal yogurt.

                    Participants are randomly placed in one (or the other) condition. If participants are placed in a
                    condition based on a specific heuristic, then there's the chance that that heuristic biases the
                    results. Without randomization, ...

                    The experiment has a control condition and at least one experimental condition (also called
                    treatment condition). The idea is to use the control condition to set a baseline of performance and
                    compare the experimental condition's performance to it. Without a control condition to compare to,
                    an experimental condition's performance cannot be adjudged to be better or worse.

                    Ideally, a participant does not know which condition he/she is in. This is needed to protect against
                    the placebo effect where a participant can demonstrate benefits based on just the fact that he/she
                    is part of an experiment. In some cases, placebo effects have been found to be as much as 70% of an
                    actual experimental effect. (ref)

                    Galileo does not suggest using blind experiments because they can be difficult to pull off in
                    practice without expert guidelines. One way to reduce the effects of non-blind conditions is to use
                    objective measures (e.g. heart rate) as compared to subjective measures (e.g. how do you feel
                    today?).
