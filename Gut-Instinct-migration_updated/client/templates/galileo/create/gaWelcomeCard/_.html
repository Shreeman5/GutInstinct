        <b>Why run experiments?</b>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                Running experiments is the only way to track causality
                <br>Example: Suppose you drink coffee and realize
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                Experiments explicitly account for confounders
                <br>Example: Suppose you’re curious to know the effect of yogurt on your gut, but travel to another
                country during the process. This change acts as a confounder - so we don’t know if any changes are due
                to yogurt, or due to change in the brand of the yogurt,
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <b>Why run long experiments?</b>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                Greater number of points provide assuming experiment is designed and run properly
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <b>Why run experiments with a large number of people?</b>
        <ul style="padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">
                Experiments run with you might be biased and might not create generalizable knowledge. Running
                experiments with more people allows us to create gold standard scientific knowledge
            </li>
