        You can debug your experiment by running a trial version on yourself for 3 days (? help - why pilot). To pilot
        your experiment you will need..

        To:
        <br>
        1. Track cause variables (???)
        <br>
        2. Track effect variables (???) and
        <br>
        3. Keep notes about your experiment. Access your experiment notebook

        2. An experiment plan
    </p>

    <p>
        To receive feedback on your experiment design from other Galileo participants
        <br>
        We've created your experiment plan
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3GUaTcjN6ux_P50IN751xiV4Zs6syAlc-3QxmnfSsQ/edit"
            target="_blank">here</a>.
        Your insights will help others and others' will help you.
    </p>

    <p class="blue-text text-darken-2" style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 100; color: black;">
        3. For better insights, get more scientists!
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="#">Invite</a> more people to join your trial run. More people face more and diverse set of issues,
        which means your experiment will improve drastically.
        <br>
        But how many participants will I need?
