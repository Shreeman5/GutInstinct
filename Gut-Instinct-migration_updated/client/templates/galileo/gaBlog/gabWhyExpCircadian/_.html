            <h2>How can people interested in exploring circadian rhythms scientifically test their intuitions?</h2>

            <div style="margin-top:40px;">
                People have intuitions about how circadian rhythms affect their health. Does eating during a specified
                few hours boost the immune system? Does doing yoga in the morning work better than at night? Does
                switching to blue light on screen improve the quality of sleep?
            </div>

            <br>
            <h4>People's tracking can yield incorrect/incomplete results</h4>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                To test our intuitions, we often make some changes in our lifestyle, and then observe the effects of
                those changes. For example, consider Janet, who thinks that her habit of drinking a glass of wine every
                night after dinner negatively affects her sleep cycle. She switches to drinking lemonade for a week and
                collects data about her sleep—how long she slept, how she felt after waking up, and so on. But her
                measurements show that she's actually sleeping less after switching to lemonade! Janet realizes that
                there could be a number of factors affecting her sleep—she could’ve been staying up late, binge-watching
                the latest season of WestWorld, or her neighbors could’ve been particularly loud that week, or it could
                be that she increased her soda intake, which has high amounts of caffeine too.
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Such unsystematic tracking activities often yield wrong or frustrating results. <i>So what could Janet
                    do to know for sure that avoiding wine at night could really help improve her sleep?</i>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Scientists and researchers have intuitions and ideas too, and they run systematic, controlled
                experiments to test their ideas. But does that mean that only researchers with a PhD can run experiments
                and test their ideas? Not at all!

            <h4>An example of community led experimentation</h4>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                In 2008 a community of 160 ALS patients came together and ran their own experiment to support research
                about their ailment! Learn about their inspiring story here:

            </div>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Now imagine what could be achieved if other communities had the tools and support to test their ideas
                through experimentation. There are many people that already collect vast amounts of data about their
                lives. But what if their tremendous efforts were spent in running scientific experiments—everyday people
                could be running their own research!
