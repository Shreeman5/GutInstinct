            <h2>How can the American Gut Project community scientifically test their ideas?</h2>

            <div style="margin-top:40px;">The American Gut Project community has intuitions about how one's gut affects
                their health.</div>

            <br>
            <h4>People's tracking can yield incorrect/incomplete results</h4>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                To test such intuitions, people often make some changes in their lifestyle, and then observe the effects
                of those changes. For example, consider Janet, who thinks that her habit of taking a probiotic every
                morning improves her energy levels throughout the day. To test this, she switches to not taking a
                probiotic for a week and tracks how she feels every day. But her measurements show that she's actually
                getting more done after avoiding her daily dose of probiotics! Janet realizes that there could be many
                factors that could be affecting her energy levels - she could’ve been staying up late binge watching
                that latest show, or she might have been eating different food, or it could be that she increased her
                soda intake which has high amounts of caffeine.
            </div>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Such unsystematic tracking activities often yield incorrect results that can be frustrating. <i>So what
                    could Janet do to know for sure that taking a probiotic could really help improve her daily energy
                    levels?</i>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Scientists and researchers have intuitions and ideas too, and they run systematic, controlled
                experiments to test their ideas. But does that mean that only researchers with a PhD can run experiments
                and test their ideas? Not at all!

            <h4>An example of community led experimentation</h4>

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                In 2008 a community of 160 ALS patients came together and ran their own experiment to support research
                about their ailment! Learn about their inspiring story here -

            <div style="margin-top:20px;">
                Now imagine if passionate communities like the American Gut Project had the tools and support to test
                their ideas through experimentation. There are many people that already collect vast amounts of data
                about their lives. Nudging these tremendous efforts towards running scientific experiments can enable
                anyone to run their own research!
