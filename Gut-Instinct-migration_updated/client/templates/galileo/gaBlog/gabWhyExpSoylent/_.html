        <h2>How can the Soylent community scientifically test their ideas?</h2>
  
        <div style="margin-top:40px;">
          The Soylent community has intuitions about how one's gut affects their health.
        </div>
  
        <br>
        <h4>People's tracking can yield incorrect/incomplete results</h4>
  
        <div style="margin-top:20px;">
          To test such intuitions, people often make some changes in their lifestyle, and then observe the effects of those changes. For example, consider Janet, who thinks that her habit of drinking Soylent every morning improves her energy levels throughout the day. To test this, she switches to not drinking Soylent for a week and tracks how she feels every day. But her measurements show that she's actually getting more done after avoiding her daily dose of Soylent! Janet realizes that there could be many factors affecting her energy levels - she couldâ€™ve been staying up late binge-watching that latest show, or she might have been eating different food, or it could be that she increased her soda intake which has high amounts of caffeine.
        </div>
  
        <div style="margin-top:20px;">
          Such unsystematic tracking activities often yield incorrect results that can be frustrating. <i>So what could Janet do to know for sure that drinking Soylent could really help improve her daily energy levels?</i>

          Scientists and researchers have intuitions and ideas too, and they run systematic, controlled experiments to test their ideas. But does that mean that only researchers with a PhD can run experiments and test their ideas? Not at all!

        <h4>An example of community-led experimentation</h4>
  
        <div style="margin-top:20px;">
          In 2008 a community of 160 ALS patients came together and ran their own experiment to support research about their ailment! Learn about their inspiring story here -

          Now imagine if passionate communities like Soylent had the tools and support to test their ideas through experimentation. There are many people that already collect vast amounts of data about their lives. Nudging these tremendous efforts towards running scientific experiments can enable anyone to run their own research!
